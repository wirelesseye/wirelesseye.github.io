< Where did you go? Are you talking to someone?
> I was talking to an old man
< An old man? The Count of Monte?
> There is no one like that here...
< How are you, Oh Dea-su? How's your life in the 'larger prison'?
> Who are you?
< A lonely prince trapped in a tall tower. Don't forget me, Princess Sashimi...^_^
